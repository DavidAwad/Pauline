# Pauline

## This poem is not written yet!! 

This is my first attempt at an open source poem.

The idea is simple, through web design we can create very uniquely tailored experiences.

You can create content that's *interactive*.

I saw this video and was inspired to write a poem about it. 

It's hosted on GitHub Pages, just go to http://davidawad.github.io/pauline/

## Thanks for reading!
