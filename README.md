# pauline
This is my first attempt at an open source poem.

The idea is simple, through web design we can create very uniquely tailored experiences.

Even better than video because you can create content that's *interactive*. 

I saw this video and was inspired to write a poem about it. 

You can read the poem at http://davidawad.github.io/pauline/ 

## Thanks!
